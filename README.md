# :christmas_tree: Advent of Code 2023 :christmas_tree:

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2023, written in Rust.

All solutions are in the same Cargo Workspace, where the solution for puzzle X can be found in the dayX package.

Every package contains unit test(s) for the example(s) from the puzzle description and will build an executable that solves the puzzle for the input file from the inputs/ directory.
